# Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM

This repository contains an implementation of **time series forecasting** using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks.  
It demonstrates how deep learning models can capture temporal dependencies in sequential data to make future predictions.  
The code is written in **Python** using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on your notebook setup).

## Features

- **LSTM Model**: Designed specifically to handle sequential and time-dependent data.
- **Time Series Data Preparation**: Creating sequences of input and output for model training.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Fitting the LSTM model and evaluating its forecasting performance.
- **Visualization**: Plotting actual vs predicted values to analyze model accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to different types of time series datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Introduction to Time Series Forecasting**: Overview of forecasting challenges and deep learning solutions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, creating input-output sequences for supervised learning.
